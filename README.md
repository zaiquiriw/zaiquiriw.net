# zaiquiriw.net
The web portal to all things Zaiquiri. While I don't have it running yet, the goal is to have the whole of my experience accessed from just this repo. This means I want this to be:
1. A portfolio website (frontend) that links to my other projects using NEXT.JS and React
2. A server (backend) that serves interactive ml models and... as an example of a backend using MongoDB with a proper API
3. A way to access obsidian notes I publish, for both a searchable repo of my knowledge, and an example of a static generated website
4. A way to get to know me!

The libraries, languages, and frameworks I hope to use are: Javascript, Python, CSS, HTML, JSX, Scala, Tensorflow, numpy, pandas, MongoDB, Express, Keras, matplotlib, and more!
